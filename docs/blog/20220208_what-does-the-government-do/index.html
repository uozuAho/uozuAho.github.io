<p>For the upcoming Australian federal election, I want a quick summary view of
what politicians have been doing in their time in office, so I can decide if I
want to vote for them or not. I am physically incapable of listening to
politicians speak, and watching the news is a pretty inefficient way of finding
this information.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://theyvoteforyou.org.au">They Vote For You</a> does a lot of
hard work to summarise what politicians are voting for in parliament. They get
their data from the <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/">Australian parliament</a>, which,
also thankfully, publishes a lot of information about what is going on.</p>
<p>They Vote For You makes it easy to see what your representatives are voting for,
but doesn&rsquo;t make it easy to see each party&rsquo;s stance on an issue. This is where
<a href="https://what-does-the-government-do.netlify.app/">my site</a> comes in. It uses
data provided by They Vote For You to show voting records at a party level.</p>
<p>Have a go! <a href="https://what-does-the-government-do.netlify.app/">https://what-does-the-government-do.netlify.app/</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not perfect - the votes recorded are from
<a href="https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/help/faq#division">divisions</a>, which only make up
a small minority of all the votes happening parliament. There is plenty more
information published by the Australian parliament, but it&rsquo;s nowhere near as
concise as the information here.</p>
<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2>
<p>I used Netlify Functions to access the They Vote For You APIs. See <a href="https://iamwoz.com/blog/20220126_netlify-functions/">my post on
Netlify Functions</a>.</p>
<p>I ended up writing the HTML myself. Hugo &amp; other static site generators all seem
to be most easily used to create blogs. I got frustrated trying to create a
custom site with Hugo. I kinda regret this choice, as there&rsquo;s already a lot of
duplication between pages, but at least it was simple-ish to put together.</p>
<p>I intended to write all the CSS myself, but quickly gave up and went with
<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. My initial version had no styling, and
my first &ldquo;hallway usability test&rdquo; failed dismally with my partner asking &ldquo;Is it
supposed to look like this? It looks broken.&rdquo; :P</p>
