<p>I am ashamed to admit that I have only just recently put the effort in to learn
this. I have known &ldquo;how to vote&rdquo; since I was eligible to vote, but have never
fully understood:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who am I voting for? What do they do?</li>
<li>How does my vote lead to people getting elected?</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a <em>lot</em> of information on the internet about this. Too much. This post
answers the above questions, in my preferred format of pictures and dot points.
Please note that I got super bored reading the many walls of text about this, so
there may be mistakes/inaccuracies in this post.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain some context first, so if you&rsquo;re impatient:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#senate">How to vote for senators</a></li>
<li><a href="#reps">How to vote for lower house representatives</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-context-what-is-the-federal-government">Some context: What is the federal government?</h2>
<ul>
<li>there are 3 levels of government in Australia: federal, state, and local</li>
<li>the federal government creates &amp; updates laws, and &lsquo;conducts affairs&rsquo; that
affect the whole nation</li>
<li>we elect &lsquo;members of parliament&rsquo; (MPs) that form the federal government</li>
<li>the federal parliament is made up of 2 &lsquo;houses&rsquo;: the upper and lower house,
also known as the senate and house of representatives, respectively</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The 2 houses exist to keep each other &lsquo;in check&rsquo;. For example, before one
house decides to wage war with China, the other house has a chance to step
in and say &ldquo;that&rsquo;s probably not a good idea&rdquo;. The representatives of each
house are chosen in different ways, to ensure diversity of opinion.</p>

<h2 id="senate">How to vote for senators (the big ballot paper)</h2>
<h3 id="casting-your-vote">Casting your vote</h3>
<ul>
<li>you vote for senators to represent your state/territory. Your vote will count
towards 12 or 2 senators being elected, depending on whether you&rsquo;re in a state
or territory.</li>
<li>you rank candidates in order of preference. This can be done by voting either
above or below the line. See the image below.</li>
</ul>

    all boxes below the line (don't vote above and below the line! Pick one!)

<h3 id="how-your-vote-gets-candidates-elected">How your vote gets candidates elected</h3>
<p>The short video below explains it better than I can. Here&rsquo;s my attempt, anyway:</p>
<ul>
<li>candidates need a quota of votes to be elected</li>
<li>quota = (total number of valid votes / number of vacancies + 1) + 1
<ul>
<li>for example: there are 1300 people in the state, and 12 senators to elect.
This means a candidate needs (1300 / 12 + 1) + 1 = 101 votes to be elected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>first preferences are counted first. If any candidate receives the required
quota of first preferences, they are elected. Any &lsquo;surplus&rsquo; ballots that have
the winning candidate as their first preference get their second preferences
distributed to remaining candidates</li>
<li>if no remaining candidate reaches the quota based on first preferences, then
second preferences are counted</li>
<li>the above process continues, using lower and lower preferences, until the
required number of senators have been elected.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>the above is slightly simplified. The amount your lower preferences contribute
depends on which state/territory you&rsquo;re in.</li>
<li>if voting below the line, you must choose at least 12 candidates. However, aim
for more, since there&rsquo;s a chance your ballot can become &rsquo;exhausted&rsquo; - i.e.
your preferences don&rsquo;t count towards any winning candidates. Even if you
dislike some candidates/parties, you should still rank them in order of your
preference, since this will count towards your &rsquo;least disliked&rsquo; candidates
getting elected.</li>

<ul>
<li>to win, a candidate must get an absolute majority
<ul>
<li>eg. receives 51% of first preference vote</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if no candidate gets a majority of first preferences, the candidate with
lowest number of 1st preferences is eliminated, and the 2nd preference from
those votes flow into the remaining candidates</li>
<li>the above is repeated until one candidate reaches the majority</li>
