<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I set up my elaborate set of mouse traps, barriers and
surveillance. See <a href="https://iamwoz.com/blog/20210613_mouse/">this post</a>. Everything has
been in place since then, and I enjoyed a few mouse-free weeks after catching
the first 3 mice. However, at least one mouse came back, and was wise enough to
avoid the existing traps, no matter what bait I used. I tried peanut butter,
cheese, bread, bird seed, vegemite and honey. It was time for a new trap.</p>
<h1 id="the-new-trap">The new trap</h1>
<p>There are plenty of ideas out there on how to build a DIY mouse trap. For
example, here&rsquo;s a big list of <a href="https://www.itsoverflowing.com/homemade-mouse-trap-diy/">DIY mouse traps</a>.
A lot of them follow a similar concept: the mouse gets lured into/onto an
unstable platform over a large container. The weight of the mouse is enough to
make the platform or just the mouse fall into the container. Here&rsquo;s my version,
using bits I had around the house:</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s peanut butter and cheese on top of the empty toilet roll. If all goes to
plan, the mouse should lose its footing on the roll, and fall into the tub.</p>
<p>At first, it looked as if the mouse was well aware that this was a
human-constructed trap, and kept its distance. Over the next couple of days,
lured by little bits of cheese I put on the ramp, the mouse got more
adventurous:</p>

<p>It looked as though again, the mouse was too smart for me.</p>

<p>The mouse was confidently strutting around the top of the tub, and carefully
examining the food in the middle of the trap from a distance. I thought I was
going to have to go back to the drawing board. But then, one morning, I heard
some noises coming from the tub&hellip;</p>

<p>I had beaten the mouse! I reviewed the night&rsquo;s footage to see that little mousey
had made a critical misstep, and its dreams of spending its retirement in my
house were over.</p>
