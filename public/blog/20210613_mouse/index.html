<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing a game of human and mouse recently. A couple of weeks ago,
as I was walking into the kitchen, I spotted a mouse darting under the fridge.
My first thought was to create an elaborate security camera system to find out
where they go in the house.</p>
<h1 id="the-setup">The setup</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;d been meaning to put together a camera system that makes it easy to observe
plants &amp; animals etc., so this was all the motivation I needed.</p>
<p>You can find all the technical details in <a href="https://github.com/uozuAho/pi_cam_v1">this repo</a>.</p>
<p>I already had most of the parts I needed to make the camera - a raspberry pi
zero, night vision camera, infrared (IR) spotlight, flexible tripod, and of
course, Blu Tack, rubber bands and determination. Here&rsquo;s the camera and
spotlight:</p>

<h1 id="day-0---the-stakeout">Day 0 - the stakeout</h1>
<p>Each evening, I set up the camera in the spot I wanted to monitor, and set it
recording. Each morning, I scanned the recorded videos for motion using a handy
tool called <a href="https://dvr-scan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">dvr-scan</a>.</p>
<h1 id="day-1---theyre-on-the-kitchen-bench">Day 1 - they&rsquo;re on the kitchen bench</h1>
<p>They&rsquo;re all over the kitchen bench, eww! How did they get there? They climbed
the network cable! Exhibit A:</p>

<p>Look at it go!</p>
<p>They also jump! Apparently their eyesight isn&rsquo;t that great, so good effort here,
for not much reward (apart from the funny video):</p>

<h2 id="the-cable-guard">The cable guard</h2>
<p>To stop them climbing the cable, I made a cable guard based on the plastic rings
I&rsquo;ve seen around some power lines. I assume those are to stop possums. My guard
is made from high quality materials: cardboard, sticky tape and Blu Tack.</p>

<h1 id="day-2---theyre-still-on-the-kitchen-bench">Day 2 - they&rsquo;re still on the kitchen bench</h1>
<p>D&rsquo;oh. The first cable guard I made was too small. It stopped them for a while,
but they outsmarted it before too long. Mice 1, Warwick 0.</p>

<p>I made a bigger guard. Hopefully they can&rsquo;t climb around this one. The photo of
the guard above is actually the bigger one I made.</p>
<h1 id="day-3---theyre-_still_-on-the-kitchen-bench-but-i-caught-one">Day 3 - they&rsquo;re <em>still</em> on the kitchen bench, but I caught one!</h1>
<p>There was no sign of the mice on the network cable this time. However, they&rsquo;re
still on the kitchen bench. How are they getting there? Time to move the camera.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;ve had traps set up around the crime scene:</p>

<p>The food/bait sits deep inside, and when the mouse goes in to get it, the lid
falls shut:</p>

<p>D&rsquo;aww he eats cheese just like I do. Off to the park!</p>
<h1 id="day-4---a-new-route-to-the-kitchen-bench-is-discovered">Day 4 - a new route to the kitchen bench is discovered</h1>
<p>I often saw the mice loitering around the dishwasher, so I set the camera up a
bit closer to see what was going on there.</p>

<p>Aha! You sneaky, clever mouse! I stood staring at this wooden panel between the
fridge and dishwasher for an unreasonably long time. Eventually, I devised a
sophisticated barrier:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/20210613_mouse/wood_panel_barrier.jpg"

<p>Cardboard again, sticky-taped to the panel. The idea was that it&rsquo;d be too fiddly
for the mice to hold on to on their way up&hellip;</p>

<p>It worked! Mice 1, Warwick 1.</p>
<h1 id="the-following-week">The following week</h1>
<p>The following few nights, I didn&rsquo;t catch any mice on the kitchen bench, but
they&rsquo;ve still been foraging around on the floor. I&rsquo;ve caught two more since, but
the &rsquo;last&rsquo; one seems to have caught on that its friends don&rsquo;t come back from the
traps. It&rsquo;s been visiting less and less, and I haven&rsquo;t seen it in the last
couple of days. The battle is over, for now&hellip;</p>
